SWITCH_IMPLEMENTATION

Task 1: MAC_table is being formed. When sending data from a host to another host, the switches only store the
        MAC address and the port of the switch through which the data came (excluding the broadcast address),
        and then floods the network with the data if destination is not known. MAC table is used only when the
        destination host has been previously discovered.

        In order to determine if an address is unicast, the "address_ is_unicast" function checks whether the
        least significat bit of the first byte is equal to 1 or 0.
        0 => unicast
        1 => not unicast (multicast or broadcast)

Task 2: The switch configuration files are read for each switch and the "vlan_ids" dictionary stores pairs of
        type {interface -> vlan_id}.
        When sending data from a host to another, multiple cases have to be taken into account, meaning that
        the frame can be sent:
        1. from a host to a switch => a 4-byte tag containing the vlan_id has to be added right after the MAC 
                                    addresses and the length of the frame has to be increased by 4.
        2. from a switch to a host => the frame is being sent only if the vlan_id of the port (towards the host)
                                    is equal to the tagged-vlan_id contained within the frame. The frame has to
                                    also be restructured, with its length decreased by 4 and the tag being removed.
        3. from a switch to a switch => the frame is passed on as it is. We know that the frame contains the tag
                                    in this case since data has to always be tagged when being transmitted through
                                    trunk ports and to switches.
        4. from a host to a host (but through only one switch) => In this case, the frame is coming through an
                                    access port and being sent through another access port. This can only happen if
                                    the hosts are connected to the same switch and are part of the same VLAN. In
                                    this case, the frame is not tagged and is being sent through the access port,
                                    but only if the vlan_id's of the two ports are equal.

Task 3: The simplified STP algorithm starts by initialising all ports to "Designated" inside the "port_state"
        dictionary which contains pairs of type {port_number -> state_of_port}. In this version of STP, the state
        of the ports can either be "Designated" or "Blocked".
        Each switch has a priority (which is read from the configuration file), and the switch with the smallest
        priority is the root_bridge of the entire network (having all ports set to "Designated").
        Initially, every switch sees itself as the root_bridge, having every port set to "Designated".
        I used global variables for bridge ID's ("own_bridge_ID", "root_bridge_ID") and costs ("root_path_cost")
        so that the variables do not have to be passed as parameters to the functions who run the STP algorithm.
        BDPU's are sent every second among switches, establishing the root_bridge and the state of the ports,
        following the rules listed in the pseudocode provided in the assignment task.
        When sending BPDU's, they have to be sent to a special address so that they can be interfered accordingly.
        Therefore, the BPDU's contain the special destination MAC address, the source MAC address of the switch
        which is sending the package (function "get_switch_mac()"), followed by the LLC header length, the LLC
        header itself, and the BPDU configuration components. Everything was transformed to bytes using "to_bytes"
        built-in function, and then concatenated together to formm the 52-byte BPDU ("BPDU_LEN") which is then
        sent across all the trunk interfaces as long as the switch is root bridge.
        The "gather_info_bpdu" function retrieves the most important elements of the BPDU (the id's and the cost
        towards the root bridge)
        Finally, the VLAN code from task 2 had to suffer a slight modification since data can only be sent through
        designated ports, meaning that if the port state is blocked, no data can be transmitted through there.
